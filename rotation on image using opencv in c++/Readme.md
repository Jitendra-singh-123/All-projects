                                                            ROTATION OF IMAGE  
 
 
 
 INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROJECT:
      This is the project on rotation of image by using opencv library in c++ language.
      About opencv:  OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library. OpenCV was built to provide a common                           infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products.
      
 TECHNOLOGIES:
      SOFTWARE:   
                  ❖	VISUAL STUDIO 2019
                  ❖	OPEN CV
      
      HARDWARE:
                  ❖	PROCESSOR:  minimum INTEL® PENTIUM® CPU @ 2.0 GHZ 
                  ❖	RAM:  2 GB(MINIMUM) 
                  ❖	STORAGE: 10 MB(MAXIMUM) 
                  ❖	OS: WINDOWS 10,8,7

      
 HOW TO RUN:
                1.Download opencv.(Open CV exe file: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/rele...)
                2.Download visual studio community.(Visual Studio 2019: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
                3.Also download desktop c++ requirements in visual studio.
                4.Do setting available in this link (https://youtu.be/riArxlmRMoQ)
                5.Once all the above 4 steps are done then just open visual studio 2019 and copy my code to your visual studio.
                6.Change the image path by your image path.
                7.At last just click on " LOCAL WINDOWS DEBUGGER ".
  HOW TO USE:
                1.Once you click on " LOCAL WINDOWS DEBUGGER ".
                2.There will be output screen with image whose path you specified in program, along with trackbar.
                3.Through this trackbar you can rotate the image.
